*** NOTE TO LINUX AND SOURCE-CODE USERS: ***

Python 2.5 or later is required to run Brain Workshop on Linux. Python 2.4
may also work as long as the python-ctypes package is installed.
[Note: Windows versions and Mac OS X .app bundled versions of Brain
Workshop have python included.]

The latest version of python can be downloaded here:
      http://www.python.org/download/releases/

Music support requires AVBin (highly recommended!)
AVBin is included in binary distributions of Brain Workshop, but source
code users will want to download AVBin here:

Detailed instructions and links for Mac OS X, Linux and win32 source
installation are available on the Brain Workshop web site:
